            <h2>Simple and Multiple Linear Regression</h2><br>


            <h4>Linear Regression </h4><br>
            <p>Regression is used to predict numerical values given inputs. Linear regression attempts
                to model the line of best fit that explains the relationship between two or more variables
                by fitting a linear equation to observed data.
                One or more variables are considered to be the independent (or explanatory) variables,
                and one variable is considered to be a dependent (or response) variable.
                In simple linear regression, there is one independent variable
                and in multiple linear regression, there are two or more independent variables.
            </p>

            <p>Before attempting to fit a linear model to observed data, a modeler should first determine whether or
                not there is a linear relationship between the variables of interest. This does not necessarily imply
                that one variable causes the other. Remember, <i>correlation does not necessarily imply causation</i>.
                For example, moderate alcohol consumption is correlated to longevity. This doesn’t necessarily mean that
                moderate alcohol consumption causes longevity. Another independent characteristic of moderate drinkers
                (extrovert lifestyle) might be responsible for longevity. Regardless, there is some association between
                the two variables.
                The goal in linear regression is to tease apart whether a correlation is likely to be a causal
                relationship, by controlling for these other variables/characteristics that might be confounding the
                analysis.
            </p>

            <p>In simple linear regression, <a href="http://www.stat.yale.edu/Courses/1997-98/101/scatter.htm"> scatter
                    plot</a> can be a helpful
                tool in visually determining the strength of the relationship between two variables. The independent
                variable is
                typically plotted on the x-axis and the dependent variable is typically plotted on the y-axis. If there
                appears to be
                no association between the proposed explanatory and dependent variables (i.e., the scatter plot does not
                indicate any
                clear increasing or decreasing trends), then fitting a linear regression model to the data probably will
                likely not provide a useful model. (Note this is not always the case--just as confounding variables
                might lead a correlation to appear stronger than it is, it might also lead a relationship to appear
                weaker than it is.)
            </p>

            <p>Shown in the picture below, in simple regression, we have a single feature x and weights w0 for the
                intercept and w1 for slope of the line. Our goal is to find the line that minimizes the vertical
                offsets, otherwise known as residuals.
                In other words, we define the best-fitting line as the line that minimizes the residual sum of squares
                (SSR or RSS) between our target variable y and our predicted output over all samples i in our training
                examples n.
            </p>

            <img src="simple_regression.png">
            <p>A valuable numerical measure of association between two variables is the <a
                    href="http://www.stat.yale.edu/Courses/1997-98/101/correl.htm"> correlation coefficient </a>, which
                is a value between -1 and 1 indicating the strength of the association of the observed data for the two
                variables. A simple linear regression line has an equation of the form <b>Y = a + bX</b>, where <b>X</b>
                is the independent (explanatory) variable and <b>Y</b> is the dependent variable. The slope of the line
                is <b>b</b>, and <b>a</b> is the intercept (the value of y when x = 0). A multiple linear regression
                line has an equation of the form <b>Y = a + b_1X_1 + b_2 X_2 + … + b_n X_n</b> for n independent
                variables.</p>
            <p>Another useful metric is the <b>R-squared</b> value. This tells us how much of the variation in Y can be
                explained by the variation in X. The value for R-squared ranges from 0 to 1, and the closer to 1, the
                greater proportion of the variability in Y is explained by the variability in X.
                For more explanation on R-squared and how to calculate it, read <a
                    href="https://online.stat.psu.edu/stat501/lesson/1/1.5"> here </a> (this will be very helpful
                in Part 2!) </p>

            <p>Do not confuse correlation and regression. Correlation is a numerical value that quantifies the degree to
                which two variables are related. Regression is a type of predictive analysis that uses a <b>best fit
                    line (Y = a + bX)</b> that predicts Y given the value of X).</p>
                    <br><h4>Part I: Data Preprocessing (18 Points)</h4><br>
            <h5> Data & Functions Overview</h5><br>
            <p>Inside the data folder, <code>bike_sharing.csv</code> contains data of a two-year historical log corresponding to years 2011
                and 2012
                from Capital Bikeshare system, Washington D.C., USA. There are 11 different independent variables that
                you are attempting to predict
                and one dependent variable (the Count of Use of Bike). More information on the dataset can be found in
                <code>README_data.txt</code>.

                <p>The data functions described below are in <code>util.py</code>and
                     can be used for both simple and multilple linear regressions.</p>
                

            </p><br>
            <h5> Load Data</h5><br>
            <p>In <code>util.py</code>, first implement <code>load_data</code>, which should load the data into X, and y variables using pandas.
                Make sure to load the correct dependent and independent variables when implementing and calling this function.
            </p><br>
            <h5> Train/Test Split</h5><br>
            <p> Then, fill in the functions <code>split_data_randomly</code> and <code>train_test_split</code> to randomly split the data
                into train and test datasets.
                You should create the following variables:<code>X_train</code>, <code>X_test</code>,
                <code>y_train</code>, <code>y_test</code>.


                A common convention in data science is to make 80% of the data the training data and 20% the test data.
                In <code>train_test_split</code>, we have provided <code>test_pct = 0.2</code>; use this in your <code>split_data_randomly</code> function to obtain this 80/20 split.
                You will train your model on the training data and test it on the test data. 
                
                </p>
                <p>Note that we expect you
                to distribute the data randomly, look into
                how you can use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html"> Python random.random </a> to do
                this. In <code>simple_regression.py</code> and <code>multiple_regression.py</code>, we set <code>random.seed(1)</code> to guarrantee that we obtain the same
                split on every run. Please do not change this.</p> 
                <p>
                Lastly, when splitting data make sure that
                X,y pairs remain intact, that is, every X and its corresponding Y should both be in the same list(either
                test or train) and at the same index to make sure your model
                is accurate. To do this, we recommend using <a
                    href="https://docs.python.org/3.3/library/functions.html"> Python zip </a>to form pairs before
                splitting the data into train and test sets.
            </p>
                <p>Note: <code>calculate_r_squared</code> function is for the next section, and you don't need to implement it at this stage.</p>
            
            <br>
            <h4>Part II: Simple Linear Regression (22 points)</h4><br>
            <p> The management team of Capital Bikeshare system wants to know how much weather conditions can
                predict bikesharing use. Please open <code>simple_regression.py</code> and implement simple
                linear regression model that predicts the number of total rental bikes per day (cnt) given the
                weather conditions (weathersit).
                
                <br><br>
                Fill in the helper functions for mean, variance and covariance. When calculating variance and covariance, you should use (n-1) as the denominator to make the estimator
                unbiased. (Note: n is the sample size.)
                <br><br>
                You cannot use numpy functions for these
                calculations. Use this in your train function to calculate the (a,b) of your regression model.
                
                <br><br>
                Then, you need to go back to <code>util.py</code> and implement <code>calculate_r_squared</code>, 
                which will be used for testing both your simple and multiple linear regressions. 
                You should use r-squared = 1 - SSE / SSTO, 
                and refer to <a
                href="https://online.stat.psu.edu/stat501/lesson/1/1.5"> this page </a> for an explanation on
            how to calculate SSE and SSTO.
            <br><br>
                Lastly, fill in the test function which is used to evaluate your model. Here you should calculate and
                return your training
                and testing mean squarred error, and your testing r-squared. 
                
                </p>

                <p>Note that you can use <a href="https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/_modules/statsmodels/tools/eval_measures.html">StatsModels and numpy</a> to calculate the MSE.</p>
            </p><br>
            <h4>Part III: Multiple Regression (20 points)</h4><br>
            <p>Wait, the management team realized that there are many more variables that affect bikesharing use in
                addition to weather conditions. They are concerned that by ignoring these variables, your simple linear
                regression might be over or underestimating the effect of weather on useage.</p>
            <p>Please open <code>multiple_regression.py</code> and using <a
                    href="https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/examples/notebooks/generated/ols.html">StatsModels </a>,
                implement a multiple linear regression. From the given 11 different independent variables, your job is
                to select the ones that could help the prediction model. See how the R-squared value changes as you
                include different independent variables to your regression model.</p>
            <p>Calling function <code>summary</code> on the results returned by the regression model will print out the
                report containing the value of each coefficient and its corresponding p-value. See the StatsModels docs
                for more details. At the end, please return your training-MSE, testing-MSE, and testing R-squared value.
            </p><br>
            <h4> Part IV: Written Questions (40 Points)</h4><br>
            <p><b>Answer the following in <code>written_questions.txt</code></b></p>

                While performing regression analysis, data scientists make several choices that require more than the data alone. Understanding the context of data is necessary to avoid statistical misinterpretation (along with many other issues!).
        <br>
        <br>
        The goal of the following questions is to: 
        <ul>
        <li> Recognize how the analysis of the same data can lead to different conclusions
        </li>
        <li> Demonstrate the importance of context to decisions during the data analysis process 
        </li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p style="font-style: italic;">Your responses should be thoughtful, provide justification for your claims, and be concise but complete. See the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hXGxoW8DQzIBh1yW2989fZhOIBgJ4w8BMN6lXjbnY-U/edit">response guide</a> for more guidance.</p>

                    <li> 
                        What factors might be influencing the bike_sharing.csv data that are not being shown in the dataset? List at least 3 possible factors. The factors could be additional variables or factors that are not quantifiable. 
                    </li>
                    <li> 
                        List one category for which it could be helpful to separate the bike_sharing.csv data into groups before analyzing it. This category may or may not be represented in the existing dataset. Describe a context (project, question, goals, etc.) for which separating the data by that category is important and explain why separating the data is the right choice for that context. 
                    </li>
                    <li> 
                        Explain at least one way that information in the bikeshare reading impacts how you should interpret bike_sharing.csv or present your findings.
